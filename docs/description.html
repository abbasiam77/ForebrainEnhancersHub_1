    <h1>Forebrain Enhancers Track Hub Description</h1>

    <p>From cellular differentiation to organismal development, the spatiotemporal expression of tissue-specific genes is driven by regulatory DNA elements. Among these, enhancers—also referred to as distal-acting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs)—are essential for increasing gene expression. Enhancers are cis-acting DNA sequences that are functional irrespective of their orientation and exhibit variable distances from their target genes.</p>

    <h2>Challenges in Annotating Tissue-Specific Enhancers</h2>
    <p>Given the critical role of tissue-specific enhancers in development and disease, annotating the human genome with tissue- or cell-type-specific enhancers has garnered significant attention. However, this task presents several challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vast Search Space:</strong> Enhancers are dispersed throughout the 98.5% of the human genome that is non-protein-coding, creating a vast search space.</li>
        <li><strong>Variable Positioning:</strong> Enhancers can regulate target genes from upstream, downstream, or intronic locations, and may skip proximal genes to influence more distant ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Gene Regulation:</strong> Some enhancers simultaneously regulate multiple genes, adding to the complexity of their annotation.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of a Universal Sequence Code:</strong> Unlike protein-coding genes, enhancers lack a defined sequence code, making prediction highly nontrivial.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Traditional Approaches and Limitations</h2>
    <p>Traditional enhancer prediction approaches, such as those based on evolutionary conservation or biochemical markers, face inherent limitations. Evolutionary methods often miss lineage-specific enhancers, while biochemical marks are not always definitive indicators of enhancer activity and can appear stochastically.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>To address these challenges, we recently developed and published (FEBS Letters, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.15030" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.15030</a>) a DNA-sequence-based enhancer prediction pipeline tailored to tissue-specific transcription factor (TF) occupancy patterns. This sequence-based model improves enhancer prediction accuracy by incorporating the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A curated set of tissue- or cell-type-relevant transcription factors.</li>
        <li>Well-characterized binding motifs for the selected TFs.</li>
        <li>A benchmark dataset of enhancers validated in vivo or in vitro for the relevant tissue or cell type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results: Predicting Forebrain Enhancers</h2>
    <p>Using the mammalian forebrain as a model, we applied this approach to predict 25,000 distinct forebrain enhancers within the non-coding and non-repetitive regions of the human genome (hg19).</p>

    <h2>Functional Evaluation of Predicted Forebrain Enhancers</h2>
    <p>Our predicted enhancer datasets were evaluated by intersecting predictions with the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Active brain enhancer-associated chromatin marks.</li>
        <li>DNase hypersensitivity (HS) site data from brain cell lines.</li>
        <li>GWAS-based brain-specific SNP data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, subsets of the predictions were experimentally validated through in vivo zebrafish transgenic models. Evolutionary analysis revealed that &gt;85% of these enhancers are conserved only in mammals or primates, underscoring their lineage-specific functionality.</p>
